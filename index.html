  <br>Today was a good day, I feel better than yesterday,
  I saw all the people in Paris, Marseille, doing the right thing,
  and in Tunisia, my aunts sent some videos of people in the see,
  of a demonstration for the people of Palestine. 
  There is a lot of people fighting the power, 
  it is beautiful.
  I need to read the newspaper, but I don't know wich one.
  Wich french newspaper should I read? Send me a message.<br></p>

  I went back to school but I'm still sick, couldn't
  play football with friends... Next time!
  I wish I was not sick, but that's okay, it's nothing.
  I saw some videos that my little brother sent me today.
  There were me very young, and him,
  and I also saw my grand-mother peparing some couscous. 
  Those videos were recorded by my father some years ago.
  Khaled.
  The class was very cool this morning, we have to make a simple book
  for next week. Fun!
  And I drew also, I'll show you tomorrow on the 3rd column of the grid.
  With love.</p> <br>

    Was a good day, had a nice dinner with my friend Pablo.
    We talked about love and stuff, it was really good!
    But I was really sick so just slept the whole day.
