  <br>Today was a good day, I feel better than yesterday,
  I saw all the people in Paris, Marseille, doing the right thing,
  and in Tunisia, my ants sent some videos of people in the see,
  of a demonstration for the people of Palestine. 
  There is a lot of people fighting the power, 
  it is beautiful.
  I need to read the newspaper, but I don't know wich one.
  Wich french newspaper should I read? Send me a message.
