    missing structural elements<br>
    the device may be in A3 I think, so A4 metal plate and A4 papers<br>
    because maybe, A1 is too big????<br>
    Hello,
Missing Structural Elements is a visual device that highlights essays and graphic experiments revolving around the idea of structure.
What is structure?

I’m interested in the grid in graphic design — but also in what it represents politically. Where does it come from?

I learned during my theory class with Zachary, an amazing teacher, that the grid is something immutable. It is imperialist and was created for capitalist purposes — to commercialize plots of land (“Jeffersonian Grid,” Designing History. Documents and the Design Imperative to Immutability, Chris Lee).

Anyway, I learned quite a lot about this grid, but I only really began to take an interest in it after discovering why I ended up growing up in Longwy, in the northeast of France.

Both my grandfathers — one from southern Tunisia and the other from northern Italy — came to work in that huge steel factory.

I recently understood why I’ve always felt a certain absence — a lack of so many “Structural Elements” related to my two cultures. I realized that all these “Structural Elements” had been erased.

The Longwy steelworks was erased from the face of the earth. I’ve never seen its remains; the few traces left have been hidden, and the stories silenced.

As I continue through life as someone deprived of “structural elements” — of culture, of meaning — I’ve turned to drawing more intensely, as if it allowed me to create some of those missing “structural elements.”

I need to look more deeply into the term structural, because I don’t think I’m misusing it.

This text is an essay accompanying a piece I’m currently developing — a device of the in-between, showing both a structure and something missing.<br>
